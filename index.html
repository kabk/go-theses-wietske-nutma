						Did you ever had that feeling when texting someone, sending an email or some other type of message that you do not know how to put into words what you want to say. You are worried that the reader will interpret it in a different way than you intended, but there are just no other words to put it, to make it feel more right. Suddenly you wish you could be there, with him/her, so that he/she could see your face and listen to how you would say it, how your body would be aiding you in your words. Not only for the receiver to understand you better but also to instantly see the reaction, the emotions playing over the face, the way he/she holds his/her body.<br>
           				&emsp;&emsp;These signals we provide help to mediate our intention when words alone do not suffice. We can always rely on our intonation, facial expression and bodily movements to change the tone of the words that we use. This non-verbal communication plays the most important part in our day-to-day contact.<br>

           				Yet the written word does not support this language. It is characterised by its restrictions, its soundless, has a fixed form, and it is flat, two-dimensional. It is a system in which we cannot (yet) be bodily present. How could one see four dimensions at once? How do you catch those shifting and subtle changes of expression in the body? The question arises how words can accurately convey their meaning if the body is not present and if they in fact can at all. They are a beautiful attempt but scoring the moving, sounding body in 4 dimensions remains elusive.<line-break>
           				This thesis argues, based on an analysis of the unique languages of both the body and the word, that a void arose in communication because the language of our body gets lost in translation. The development of technology over the last hundred years only enforces this loss, this disembodiment. In contrast, it examines the manner in which the human body is captured and depicted through different (more artistic) writing methods, that try to break through all the aforementioned limitations of language, in search of a true writing of the body. Fiona Banners’s Perfomance Nudes and Christine sun Kim’s drawings among other things will help us to see the body as more of a communicative tool, one that escapes the grasp of words.
           				Through them we can discover how this void in communication not only has its negative qualities but how it in fact can be used as a (artistic) tool from which new methods can emerge. Methods where meaning can occur across linguistic understanding.

						There is a language which we (as humans) barely even notice. One we do not actively ‘read’ but understand subconsciously, its recognition resonates deep within us.

						It is the language of our body, the non-verbal aspects of communication to which Shakespeare’s text alludes. This unspoken dialogue, all those messages that people exchange beyond the words themselves, is crucial and often overshadows the verbal communication that is going on. Humans have been so preoccupied with the word and our ability to give words to our emotional condition, that we tend to overlook the fact that our body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distancing, timing, and physical surroundings all play a part in creating the total communication. Together all these aspects can tell one story while our words may be telling another. If we analyse what it in fact adds to our communication we can see that we unintentionally very much rely on this nonverbal type of communication. <mark>“Nonverbal communication is omnipresent, its facets pervade virtually every communicative act.”<sup>4</sup></mark>

						Our bodies are constantly in motion, when talking to each other we move our hands, eyes, face and body, even when we’re just listening. It is also not limited to conversation, we can indicate our state of mind by just touching our face. These signals provide a lot of information, e.g. the way you stand while talking to someone - how you move your feet, hands, eyes and eyebrows - says a lot about your involvement in the conversation and your underlying attitude towards the other. How long you’re talking and how often you are interrupted also plays a role. The position of your arms and legs, both while sitting and standing, can show your mood and intention. The way you smile - the facial muscles you use and how fast you use them - shows whether you’re really happy or just pretending, if you’re lying or telling the truth, or if you’re feeling anxious, miserable, superior or insecure.<sup>5</sup>

        				&emsp;&emsp;Body language is something we learn through experience. It is by looking at each other signals and imitating them that we understand what they can accomplish. It is a process that evolves naturally in each and every one of us, often without conscious thought. It is funny to see how some movements are so literal, covering the mouth for instance, is an important sign of lying, perfectly illustrated in the photograph below by Bill Clinton. When he had to testify before the Grand Jury during his impeachment investigation, he repeatedly touched his mouth. As if he did not want to let the the truth escape between his fingers.<sup>9</sup>

						Some of these behaviours, such as the example above, are universal. Wherever you are, blushing remains a sign of embarrassment, shrugging the shoulders a sign of indifference, and the sincere smile a sign of joy. <mark>“They allow people to communicate with one another at the most basic level regardless of their familiarity with the prevailing verbal language system. Such nonverbal actions thus transcend cultural differences, forming a kind of universal language.”<sup>10</sup></mark>

       					Your body language is thus an outward reflection of your emotional condition. Each gesture or movement (or one of the other aforementioned aspects) can be a valuable key to an emotion a person may be feeling at the time. They help to mediate our intention and add to our words. This way of ‘adding’ to our communication is extremely important because we understand each other better. Moreover, your body is what shapes you as a person, it makes you who you are. Everyone moves a little differently within it. How you look, how you shape your gestures, how your voice sounds, all plays a significant role in how you make your way of communicating recognisable to someone else. The written word, on which I will further elaborate in the next chapter, does not support this language. Or at least not in its entirety. Therefore the question arises if this degree of individuality, which is present in our body, can be communicated in words alone. In language, in this mediation, we lose most of these nonverbal features. <br>
        				&emsp;&emsp;Because of this loss a gap appears in between the sender and the receiver, we can ‘read’ how people feel but no longer ‘see’ it. It is a gap prone to miscommunication. To explain this concept of miscommunication more clearly I would like to use an analogy of two people building a bridge. Communication is often seen as a bridge between people. Alone and wandering in our minds we frantically try to reach each other. We are moved by our inner urge to share life, to make contact and to not be alone. Language became our sharing tool, the tool with which we can build that bridge. Communicating something to someone else through written words is like building one part of the bridge while not being in sight of the other person. In his understanding the other person is building their part, the second part, towards yours. As you come closer and closer together it might become apparent that you were not heading for the same direction after all, there is a gap, a void deprived of concrete meaning. To reach the other you must take the leap and hope you get it right as you jump across.

						In communication we can make a distinction between what you say and how you are saying it, in the previous text I have tried to argue that we need the body to accomplish the second part. It is through small signs that we carry across tone and the intended underlying meaning. These tells become difficult to preserve in the crossing through a medium from one person to another. If we analyse this process it becomes evident that it is only logical that meaning can get distorted beyond recognition. Walter J. Ong described this transition perfectly: <mark>“My mind is a box. I take a unit of ‘information’ out of it, encode the unit (that is, fit it to the size and shape of the pipe it will go through), and put it into one end of the pipe (the medium, something in the middle between two other things). From the one end of the pipe the ‘information’ proceeds to the other end, where someone decodes it (restores its proper size and shape) and puts it in his or her own box-like container called a mind.”<sup>11</sup></mark>

					<p class="paragraph">
						I want to illustrate the consequences of this communication model further with a game I used to play as a kid. In the game the players form a line, the first player comes up with a message and whispers it in the ear of the second person in line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on. When the last player is reached, he or she announces the message they heard to the entire group. The first person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass around the message without it becoming unrecognisable along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless, this usually ends up happening. So as you can see in each retelling something is altered, each (in this case) person leaves its mark on the message, just like any medium would do. In the game this happens because of factors such as anxiousness, impatience, difficulty in understanding or the deliberate alteration of a word. In for example a tweet, the 150-character limit, which renders most punctuation obsolete, forms a restriction that ensures a change.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In a face-to-face conversation a recipient is always present, a conversation also demands anticipated feedback in order to take place at all. When you speak, you address another and somehow you already have to be in connection with the mind of that other person. You have to sense something in the mind of the other to which your own utterance can relate. What you say depends on what you anticipate as a response. Of course this does not mean that you know exactly what the other person will say but you need to have some kind of inclination. Therefore, when in conversation, you are both sender and receiver. It is never one-way.<sup>12</sup> 
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						<sup>12</sup> Ibid.,
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Part of the complication of the communication model described above is that the communication is in fact one-way. As a writer of the message you get the task to conjure up the recipient as he is not present in the actual moment. It is very hard to write or read if you can only envision the reader, to get into the mind of an absent person. Think back to the metaphor of the bridge I used earlier. In addition every reader measures what he or she reads within his/her own knowledge of language, concepts and images. Everyone’s interpretation is therefore different. There is never one possible outcome.

						The quote above is from artist Fiona Banner from her project titled “Perfomance Nudes”, Toronto, 2007. She moulds language like a sculpture. Imagine the setting of that of a classical life drawing. Banner is standing on a stool in front of an enormous canvas she goes back and forth between the model and the white sheet, checking, readjusting and shaping until she is satisfied. But Banner does not actually draw, she creates a textual portraits of her models. She describes them in her handwriting, starting at the top left and completely filling the surface as time flies by, word after word. She writes in a very straightforward manner, seemingly without any syntax or linguistic coherence. The words seem to express her thoughts just as they appear. Through them we become aware of all her artistic choices, we experience what it is like to be in her head, to see where her focus lies at what time. Through language a very real tangible body emerges, closely related to the artist’s mind.

						Words, emotions and feelings exist in your mind but in place with no shape, you don’t actually know where they are. Although linguistic expressions such as “It is somewhere in the back of my mind” exist and express our desire to give shape to our mind, to see it as a landscape in which we navigate, the mind does not take an actual form. Which only adds to the mystery of what happens inside of it. Thus trying to express that, capture it as a still form on paper may seem a little bit like magic. Before literacy became available to the masses, the ability to read and write was recognised as a form of power, and seemed in the eyes of ordinary people like an occult art. The Latin word grammar (meaning the structure and system of a language) only strengthens this belief, it came from old French gramaire which meant <mark>“learning”</mark> but also <mark>“(magic) incantation, spells”.<sup>14=5</sup></mark>

						Words and our ability to wield them, and the strength of them strung together is something magical indeed. Language enables us, through speech, to communicate all that we see, hear, feel or think to others. To share. The only thing is that our knowledge of those words determines our ability to express ourselves, we are caught in a framework. Even though language, especially spoken language, is a growing thing and new words are thought of all the time, language to me poses quite the struggle. It can be very alienating if you feel you're unable to give voice to what you feel. In english we also talk significantly about ‘finding the right words’. Metaphors of searching, expressing, translating thoughts into words highlight the difficulty of language, the unavoidable inadequacy of language. Giving the impression that what we are and what we feel are hard if not at all impossible to translate into words. Therefore finding the right words requires effort, you need to taste them, chew them, let them pass through your lips until the moment comes when you feel them vibrating throughout your whole body clicking into place. Luckily our living breathing body fills that gap to some extent, we can always rely on our intonation, body language, facial expression and bodily movement to change the tone of the words that we use. This non-verbal communication probably playing the bigger part in our day-to-day contact. Together they (the body and the word) give you a grip on your environment, on countless phenomena that would otherwise be chaotic and frightening. By talking about it, you gain control over it, you develop understanding, you can distance yourself and you can become thoughtful.<br>    
   						&emsp;&emsp;Through writing this process becomes transparent to others, by recording the ephemeral and providing the fleeting word with a shape that can be analysed, you give it flesh and a foundation. It can be looked over and reacted upon by others. The writing also helps to define you and what you are, what you think and what you feel. It brings about a certain justification, by giving form you acknowledge that those feelings are present and true. What you wrote now also exists across space and time, you can put it away, you can send it to someone else, you can put it on the wall, but the letters and the words will stay.

   						Throughout my life I have always kept notebooks, if I had to work through personal troubles, I kept a diary as evidence. Partly so that I knew that it had happened (it somehow seemed more true) but also for me to look back on the person I was in that time. There was a moment somewhere last year when I found one from when I was eleven years old. And it was a bit like greeting an old friend. Now the things I wrote down seemed silly, nothing to worry over, but through the text I could recall what it had been like to be me at that time. I was perfectly preserved between those pages, and it reminded me a bit of the practice of drying flowers between the pages of a book. That part of me, that text, was just like that dead flower that had once been alive, faded but frozen in time.<br>
   						&emsp;&emsp;This association between death and text is nothing new, Plato over 2365 years ago already hinted at it in his Phaedrus (274-7). In this dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates say the following, <br><mark>“Your affection for it [writing] has made you describe its effects as the opposite of what they really are. In fact, it will introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from the inside, completely on their own. You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding…”<sup>16</sup></mark>

   						Writing, according to Plato, is in-human, just a thing, it is trying to give shape to something that can only exist in the mind. Although the issue of the destruction of memory because of written-down text, may not be a contemporary one, (I would rather say that text has been a great asset as disseminator of knowledge, tradition, history and culture), I can agree to the notion of the lifelessness of text. Writing, as an invention, was quite a drastic one, it may not seem so nowadays since it is so deeply interiorised in our culture, but it does in fact reduce dynamic sound and movement (faculties of the body) to a still space, it separates the word from the living presence.

   						Not everything you can do is just as good in writing, how would one for example represent a dialect, a deep voice or a soft or loud one. Written language is a far from perfect representation of speech sounds. To be fair, the goal of written text is of course not to reproduce speech the way we pronounce it, but rather to code it so that the reader can quickly retrieve the meaning of the words. The balance between this fast transmission of meaning and a proper representation of sound is hard to find and it is only logical that somewhere along the way concessions had to be made. But written language therefore generally needs more explanation especially when the meaning is hidden in the context which is often the case in speech. We are very good at implying something while we do not use actual words to do so. 'It’s not what you said but the way you said it' can be a recognisable example. There is no easy way to translate these instances of hidden meaning. Instead we would add '… she said with a slight rise in voice” or '… the half smile that curved her mouth made her words seem warm and welcoming'.<sup>17</sup>

   						Words can be visual in their own way and help us to paint a picture in our mind. We can describe everything to the letter. But they lack the spirit and energy of life, of the body. The abstraction and distance of written language makes it difficult to give letters the same emotional, raw power. Their existence is a silent one.

						Christine Sun Kim is a sound artist and composer who was born deaf. In her work she combines and transforms the various types of notation that shape her understanding and communication. She explores the materiality of sound through its visualisation in drawing, painting and performance. She believes that you cannot just experience sound through your ears, it can be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea. In a lot of her drawings she makes use of the dynamic markings from music notation to visualise her experiences with sound. These markings are one of the most expressive elements in music notation, they can communicate a particular emotional state or feeling by determining the loudness between notes or phrases. The two basic dynamic indications are p for piano, meaning soft, and f for forte, meaning loud. These two go on in multiple variations such as fff, piu ché fortissimo, meaning very very loud, ff, fortissimo, meaning louder, ppp, piu ché pianissimo, meaning very very soft, etc.<sup>18</sup>

						By combining these musical notations with language, I believe she creates a new notation system. A system which can indicate sound by describing if it is soft or loud or something in between. If we analyse the richness of our voice, we can see that through intonation, it can indicate attitudes and emotions of the speaker. Which involves, among other aspects, a difference in loudness. It helps to focus attention on important elements of the spoken message and to regulate conversational interaction. Yet in written language there is no notation system to indicate this variation. Of course punctuation covers this field to some extent, e.g., with the use of the question mark to indicate doubt or the exclamation mark to denote a strong feeling such as an outcry or an emphatic, or ironic component, but not in its entirety. Through the use of these dynamic markings, as shown in Kim’s work, we can capture the fleeting notion of variation in sound. It could serve as an extra linguistic component to carry across the meaning of our words.

						 Such as in “All. Day.”, where she traced the path on paper that her hand would make to communicate the concept “all day” in ASL (American Sign Language).<br>
						Kim thus uses her body as an active element in her drawings. The echo of the movement that is present within the line brings across information, more information it would seem than the written down equivalent. Now we can see a part of her, of her body. It is a line that only she can make. She took the concept “all day” and then characterised it with her body, traced it over with the marks of her pulses and breathings, her excitement, hesitation, flaws and mistakes. These marks are precious things.

						This formality that is inherent in written language only gets enforced by the strict black-and-white typography on the page. Writing used to be an act of the body, it retained a vestigial connection to it. A line of ink pressed into the paper was, and still is, evidence of the will, a mark of the presence of the individual. This is why if we want other people to know that we think about them we sent them a handwritten card, or sign a document with our signature. Writing by hand takes effort, people value this effort because it means we spent time on it, time we could have spent in another way. Through our handwriting we get a very strong physical sense of the emergence of language, after all we use our hands to shape something that was not there before.

						By writing we press our body into the object and leave an impression. We create. In historical forms of writing our effort stood in direct connection with the readability and the durability of the text. We engraved our words into objects in order to transmit information and share knowledge, but objects are treacherous and will always possess a tendency towards entropy and make any mark made upon it or in it eventually disappear. To ensure the longest survival of a written text writers thus faced the choice between writing that remained legible for a long time, in which case the writing took a lot of effort (engraving in e.g. bronze or marble) or the writing is effortless (engraving in e.g. clay).<sup>24</sup>

						The effort involved in writing has only decreased over the past century. Ever since the invention of movable type which laid the groundwork for machines such as the typewriter and the word processor our bodily involvement in writing has been on the decline. Our phones and laptops with their keyboards nowadays only seem to be in favour of this disembodiment of writing.
					</p>
					<p class="empty">
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						This disembodiment occurred because the body no longer stands in direct connection with the tool it wields to create the written text. Mind and body were separated when the first electronic devices, such as the word processor, came to stand in between them. Moreover, the text’s physical qualities disappeared as it transgressed from being an object to an image. 
   						&emsp;&emsp;The automatisation of the writing process started with the typewriter, it was the first machine that could write faster that one could by hand. In a way the making of the letters was similar to the way that printers used moveable type. Typically a typewriter has an array of keys and upon pressing one causes a hammer containing a different single character to be struck against a cloth ribbon with dried ink thereby transferring the impression to the paper. In the earlier versions, dating back to 1868, this array of keys was alphabetically ordered and the keys resembled those of a piano, later on it evolved in the QWERTY keyboard that we still use today. It is an interesting observation to make that regardless of the order, the basic notion of individually separated letters distributed across a grid originated over more than 150 years ago, still taking part in our most cutting edge technology.

   						The revolutionary part in the birth of this machine that I want to emphasise here was not necessarily the fast transmission of a letter from your fingers to the paper but rather the introduction of the key. All communication must be translated in order for it to reach someone else, with ‘translation’ I mean the requirements or limits of the medium that the message has to go through. With language this is of course the translation of your feelings into words so that the other might understand you. But with this machine there was an additional form of translation namely the encoding of a shape previously made with the hand, now executed by a finger pressing a key. Which is a significantly smaller movement. The line of thinking that resulted in these keys was the endeavour towards producing the perfect ‘original’. Providing the user with a form of editing and correction before everything is finally committed to paper. The text was now set on a screen, without any existence of its own, no material trace, written through and endless ethereal stream of 0’s and 1’s. One push on a key and it is gone forever. Or as Joe Moran phrased it <mark>“Writing on a screen can feel like building a sandcastle and then kicking it over yourself.”<sup>25</sup></mark>

   						 It is through these keys that we truly lost the connection between our body and the text. Why? You may ask. Because we cannot see anymore that we made use of it [the body] in the rendering of the shape. The form that appears on paper is neat, clear and orderly arranged, not at all representative of the individual. Anybody, literally any different body, could have made those. 
   						 &emsp;&emsp;In addition, the process of printing the letter also continued to become less and less transparent. With the typewriter one could see the mechanism working, a simple process from a to b, if I press this letter down this bar swings up. The same with the pen albeit in a different way, if I move this pen a line will appear. Now everything gets hidden by glossy casings, plastic or metal boxes that intrude in our line of sight. The electrical circuits in which our letters are stored are hidden from the eye. And even if we open the machine up there is no obvious clue as to how the machine does it. It just reveals a maze of intricate circuits and a collection of silicone chips hardwired to a printed circuit board. Tiny even more complicated mazes are again inside these chips. Villem Flusser said <mark>“With word processor, writing by pressing keys has long since become an opaque process, an event that occurs in a black box to which we have no visual access.”<sup>26</sup></mark>

   						We know that when we press for example a button with an ‘e’ on it an ‘e’ will appear on the screen but the matter of how and why is shrouded in mystery. The keyboard thus taught us how to write, it branded itself in our muscle memory and conditioned in us a trust that each key will do what it is supposed to do. As we use keys more and more to convey meaning to each other (where previously the body was involved) whole actions tend to be wrapped up in one small motion. We have become so familiarised with keys that we use them without thinking. They are everywhere. We can flick a switch and the light will turn on, turn a key and open a door, push a button and whip humanity of the face of the earth. Pushing down, flicking up, turning left or right. Inherently all these movements are the same.

						Jeppesen’s work is in affiliation with the hybrid art form called 'Asemic Writing', which is a wordless, open semantic form of writing. There is an absence of meaning waiting for the reader to fill in or interpret. Similar to the way in which meaning is deduced from a piece of art. Text and image are fused in unity. It is writing for the sake of writing, no verbal context is needed.<sup>29</sup>

						It is by looking at these expanded gestures of handwriting in Jeppesen’s work that we hover in a state between reading and looking. I believe that these drawings, these marks that he made with his body, allow for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding.

						By laying bare the writing process and the steps through which we slowly lost our body, I voiced a lot of critique towards the way in which our writing lacks important communication and individuality. However, I do not mean to say that we have not tried to accomplish the best with the means that we have.<br>
   						&emsp;&emsp;In the digital communication methods in mainstream media that we use to contact one another like WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook etc. we have been trying our best to bring our body back, that individual, in order to overcome the cold formality of the typographic message and to get an inclination of who it is we are actually talking to. In for example Whatsapp, like in other messaging platforms, the presence of the reader is simulated through the use of a picture in the left corner, we can also see if they are on- or offline, if they are typing a reply, if they have read our message etc. All this to help the writer envision (to get into the mind of) the person he/she is talking to.<br>
   						&emsp;&emsp;If we look at the gesture in isolation from the rest of our non-verbal types of communication we can see that it has resurfaced through the use of the Graphic Interchange Format, also known as the GIF. The GIF. has the ability to save several images in succession, therefore allowing an animation to be displayed. Often they show a short moment from a movie scene sometimes accompanied by a piece of text. If we come across them in our feed, in a digital conversation or in some type of display, we often feel a sense of recognition. They somehow ring true. In a thesis on the GIF by Iris Cuppen she explains that <mark>“Most GIF’s do not focus on important scenes that define the narrative from which they are extracted but show “in-between” moments: the turning of a head, the wink of an eye, the pointing of a finger or the wave of a hand.”<sup>30</sup></mark>

   					<p class="paragraph">
   						It’s essentially these small movements in our communication that tend to escape our conscious mind but play an important role in how we subconsciously position ourselves towards each other when in conversation. Through the GIF these actions are cut out, zoomed in upon and shown in an endless loop. They provide us with a tool that “allows its user to still carry out meaning outside the realm of text through the depiction, sharing and editing of bodily action.”<sup>31</sup>

   				    	More alternatives such as the emoji or the voice message occur in online communication in an attempt to establish emotional tone. For all these translations merely accomplish the same thing, they enhance the power of the words or display an inherent meaning that language isn’t able to capture. Note that all these different methods only tackle individual parts of the body, it is either through visual or auditory means. Even a video call, intended to unite all aspects of the body and therefore surpass all the complications surrounding a correct interpretation, tends to focus only on the face since the screen is so small, the rest is hidden outside the frame, invisible to the eye. We can only dissect the body and individually translate all the elements but not reinvoke it through the digital medium as a whole. The irony present in all these methods is that they seem to point to the absence of the individual rather than vouching for his or her presence.

						Not only in art can language express such individuality. There are instances in everyday life where the strong connection between the written word and the body becomes visible as well. Such as when the body is used as (or in combination with) a poster to convey a message. One of the disadvantages of speech is its ephemerality, its understanding is limited to just those present at the moment when you pronounce the words. In an effort to overcome that particular problem and to get more attention for the message people started using the poster as a medium. On it’s own the typed text on the poster, as I argued before, possesses a certain distance, the message can be from anyone. In addition, it remains a largely static medium, as it is pasted upon walls or installed in advertising units.<br>     
						&emsp;&emsp;However, when the word and the body come together, they both play an active role and the body with its own mimic makes the message personal again. They complement each other, making up for each other flaws. The message now reaches the viewer, coming closer towards them, often even literally.<br>   
						&emsp;&emsp;In fact mobile posters can be traced back to the earliest years of the medium. In London in the nineteenth century ‘Boardmen’ were roaming the streets. Walking in between carriages and pedestrians the sandwich board wearer earned a meagre existence carrying commercial messages on the chest and back while navigating endless circuits of London, sandwiched between street and pavement.'<sup>32</sup>

						In forms of protest this connection becomes even more powerful. During the First World War suffragettes became ‘Boardwomen’ by wearing big letterpress posters demanding votes for woman. As they were facing difficulty in getting publicity displayed in public settings in the United Kingdom, suffragette groups such as the Women’s Freedom League regularly organised what they called ‘Poster Parades’. They took their message to settings that were the domain of men.<sup>33</sup>

						Another example would be the Memphis Sanitation Strike in Tennessee in 1968. Sanitation workers assembled in front of the Clayborn Temple for a solidarity march. The workers all carried posters with the slogan ‘I am a Man’. The dozens of silkscreened posters drew the lens of the media to broadcast their messages and when captured by the press photographers became enormously powerful images.<sup>34</sup>

						We can see that the poster becomes an extension of the body, they work together seamlessly in conveying the message. Their intention is felt throughout most of the senses. The posters now become, instead of flat static objects, individual gestures of the body. Even if their affects are amplified by collective action; they operate at a human scale, the body’s scale, literally. We can see the person holding the message and we recognise an individual, someone just like us, crying out his or her message to the world. Both through visual and auditory means.

						My motivation in doing this research originated from a very simple desire to bridge the gap I felt was present in communication. The void (created by the written word) between you and me, deprived of clear meaning, where we can only ever guess after each others true intention. It seemed an unscalable barrier, one where a set of wrongly placed words can make all the difference. I did not know why I felt that the use of words didn’t seem adequate enough, only that it did. After all, how could it be so simple? A collection of black-and-white characters on a white background. How is that representative of me? How can I express through them, what I feel, to you? And how would you be able to understand exactly, if what you interpret the words to be is shaped by your own life, which is so different from mine. It seemed a mystical way of communicating. <br>

						Words dictate my existence, our existence, and I struggled with them as if they were my only means of carrying across meaning, of bringing something to the light. Oblivious to the fact that my body, the one that gives shape, sound and movement to language can reveal so much more.<br>
   						&emsp;&emsp;Trying to understand how this gap came to be, why it is there, and if I was the only one experiencing its persistent presence in my life, led me to discover how important our body is in our communication. This was the missing factor in the written word all along. By analysing in how many ways our body can express meaning beyond the use of language, I found that I had always relied heavily on its presence. I realised that this amazing, living, breathing shell of mine just cannot be captured in any other medium than itself. The body is what gives shape. The term ‘embodiment’ only emphasises its unique nature. In essence it means ‘to shape’. By including the word ‘body’ in the term it becomes clear that our body is the definitive standard for giving and expression form.

   						Throughout this text I used the intermission as a model to provide a contrast to the arguments in my writing, to present more shades of meaning. One could see it as an entr’acte in a theatre play, meaning ‘in between acts’. While it is true that this void I described arose from a disconnection with the body, does not mean that it doesn’t have its own qualities. Maybe the word ‘void’, which has a negative annotation to it, is not the right one. Instead we should see it as a ‘space’, one in-between sender and receiver, in-between body and language, in-between meaning and interpretation, a hybrid that is concerned with its own kind of meaning, a communicative tool that does not allow itself to be captured through only words. It is a space that allows for new discoveries to be made. A space where the body makes words come to life, where they can touch and shape together. One where we can bend these limitations to our will. This is what happens in the drawings of Christine Sun Kim and Travis Jeppesen, the performances of Fionna Banner and the forms of protest that we analysed. They make us aware of all the different layers in which the body can act and they all have found a way where language is no longer the only medium that carries meaning. They have found a way to communicate their individual voice. This is what we should strive for, a more expressive use of language, a combination in which language and the body are both equally present, where they complement, instead of defy, each other. Watching the body is no mystery, what you ‘see’ or ‘feel’ is happening, whether you are consciously aware of it or not. The joy is that we are all silently skilled in ‘reading’ the body. And if in fact more of it will come to the light, if the body’s presence in words increases (as shown in the intermissions) then I believe a more complete understanding will arise from it. One not so prone to miscommunication. One where you cannot only ‘see’ but also ‘feel’.

   						Do not think that I did not recognise that this thesis however is words, plain black-and-white text. I am fully aware that by conveying my ideas by using only the word, I am guilty of the same as what I argue against. I have to be honest here and say that without this body to support me I am actually still searching for my own type of language, a way to make it personal.
